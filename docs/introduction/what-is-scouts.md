# What is Scouts?

## Introduction to Scouting

Scouting is a worldwide movement that aims to support young people in their physical, mental, and spiritual development so that they may play constructive roles in society. Founded over a century ago, Scouting has grown into one of the largest youth organizations in the world, with millions of members across hundreds of countries.

## The Scouting Movement

Scouting was founded by Lord Robert Baden-Powell in 1907 with the aim of teaching young people valuable skills through outdoor activities, service, and leadership. The movement encourages young people to become self-reliant, resourceful, and community-minded.

## Core Values and Principles

Scouting is based on a set of core values that guide the actions and behaviors of all members:
- **Duty to Self:** Encouraging personal growth and development.
- **Duty to Others:** Promoting service to the community and respect for others.
- **Duty to God or Higher Principles:** Reflecting on one's beliefs and values.

These values are reflected in the Scout Promise and Law, which all members commit to when they join.

## Age Sections and Progression

Scouting is divided into age-specific sections, each designed to provide age-appropriate challenges and learning opportunities:

## Benefits of Scouting

Scouting offers a range of benefits that contribute to the overall development of young people:
- **Leadership Skills:** Scouts are given opportunities to lead their peers in various activities and projects.
- **Outdoor Adventures:** From camping and hiking to canoeing and abseiling, Scouts engage in exciting outdoor activities that teach resilience and self-reliance.
- **Community Involvement:** Scouts participate in community service projects, helping them develop a sense of civic responsibility.
- **Life Skills:** Scouting teaches practical skills such as first aid, navigation, cooking, and problem-solving.

## How Scouting Works at Belmont

At Belmont Scouts, we are committed to providing a safe and supportive environment where young people can grow and thrive. Our leaders are dedicated volunteers who guide Scouts through the program, helping them achieve their goals and earn badges that recognize their accomplishments.

Each section meets weekly at the Belmont Scout Den, where we engage in a variety of activities, from games and crafts to outdoor adventures and community service projects.
