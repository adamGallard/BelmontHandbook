# Program Overview

The Australian Scout program provides a wide range of exciting and educational opportunities for youth members. Scouts are guided by the principles of the Scout Law and Promise, while engaging in a variety of challenging activities that help develop their physical, mental, and emotional skills. 

The program is built on **three key elements** that ensure all Scouts can develop into resilient, confident, and capable individuals:
1. **Youth Leading, Adults Supporting**
2. **Plan>Do>Review**
3. **The SPICES Framework**

## Core Components

### 1. Youth Leading, Adults Supporting
Scouts are given the responsibility to lead their own journey with guidance from adult leaders. This principle helps build leadership and decision-making skills from a young age.

### 2. Plan>Do>Review
The **Plan>Do>Review** cycle is integral to the Scout program, ensuring that activities are well-planned, executed, and then reviewed for improvement and learning.

### 3. SPICES Framework
The SPICES framework focuses on six developmental areas:
- **Social**
- **Physical**
- **Intellectual**
- **Character**
- **Emotional**
- **Spiritual**

These areas provide Scouts with a well-rounded developmental approach that helps them grow into responsible and active members of the community.

## Program Essentials

The **Program Essentials** is a structured progression system that ensures Scouts experience all that the program has to offer. Scouts work through various stages, including:
- **Outdoor Adventure Skills (OAS)**
- **Special Interest Areas (SIA)**
- **Milestones**
- **Peak Awards**

Each stage offers unique challenges and opportunities for personal development and growth.

For more detailed information about the Program Essentials and how it works, visit the [Scouts Australia Program Essentials page](https://scouts.com.au/blog/2019/03/28/the-program-essentials/).

## Outdoor Adventure Skills (OAS)
The **Outdoor Adventure Skills (OAS)** focus on key outdoor activities and skills across nine areas:
1. **Bushcraft**
2. **Bushwalking**
3. **Camping**
4. **Canoeing**
5. **Cycling**
6. **Paddling**
7. **Ropework**
8. **Sailing**
9. **Vertical Activities**

Scouts progress through nine levels within each of these areas, gaining more advanced skills and experience as they move forward.

## Special Interest Areas (SIA)
**Special Interest Areas (SIA)** allow Scouts to explore specific areas of personal interest. These projects are planned, executed, and reviewed by the Scout, giving them control over their personal development.

Projects may fall into categories such as:
- **Adventure and Sport**
- **Arts and Literature**
- **STEM**
- **Environment**
- **Growth and Development**
- **Creating a Better World**

## Milestones and Peak Awards
Scouts can achieve **Milestones** as they progress through the program. These milestones act as checkpoints of development and growth.

The **Peak Awards** are the highest achievements in each section of Scouting. Each section (Joeys, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers, Rovers) has its own unique Peak Award, symbolizing the completion of that section's journey.
