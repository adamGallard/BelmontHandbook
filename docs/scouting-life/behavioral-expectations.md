# Behavior Expectations

At Belmont Scout Group, we believe that fostering a positive, respectful, and inclusive environment is essential to the success of our group. All Youth Members, Leaders, and Parents play a vital role in ensuring that our activities are enjoyable, safe, and productive.

## Expected Behavior

All Youth Members are expected to:

1. **Show Respect**  
   Respect fellow members, Leaders, and the environment. This includes respecting different opinions, personal space, and property.

2. **Follow Instructions**  
   Listen to and follow instructions given by Leaders during activities. This ensures the safety and enjoyment of all participants.

3. **Be a Team Player**  
   Work together with fellow Scouts. Scouting is built on cooperation, and being a team player helps everyone succeed.

4. **Be Honest and Trustworthy**  
   Honesty and integrity are core values in Scouting. Youth Members are expected to uphold these values in their actions.

5. **Take Responsibility for Actions**  
   Own your behavior and accept the consequences when mistakes are made. Learning from these experiences is part of personal growth.

6. **Participate Fully**  
   Give your best effort in all activities, engage with your fellow Scouts, and help others when possible.

7. **Look After the Environment**  
   Take care of the environment by leaving no trace and being mindful of waste, particularly during outdoor activities.

8. **Maintain a Positive Attitude**  
   Approach every activity with a positive attitude, even when challenges arise. A positive outlook helps everyone enjoy their time in Scouting.

## Parents and Leaders Expectations

- **Encouragement**: We encourage parents and Leaders to support Youth Members in meeting these expectations and helping to develop their skills in communication, problem-solving, and responsibility.
  
- **Lead by Example**: Leaders and Parents should model respectful, positive behavior to create an environment that encourages growth and cooperation.

## Linked Procedure

If expectations are not met, the [Behavior Management Procedure](../policies-safety/behavior-management) will be applied. This procedure helps ensure that issues are addressed consistently and fairly, ensuring that Belmont Scout Group remains a positive and supportive environment for all.
