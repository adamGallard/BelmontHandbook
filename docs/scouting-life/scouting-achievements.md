# Scouting Achievements

At Belmont Scout Group, we encourage all Youth Members to strive towards their Scouting achievements. These achievements recognize growth, skills development, and personal accomplishments throughout a Scout's journey. Below are the key areas where Youth Members can earn their achievements.

All progress and achievements are recorded in the **Terrain System**, which is used to track the skills and levels attained by Youth Members.


## Outdoor Adventure Skills (OAS)

Outdoor Adventure Skills (OAS) are a core part of the Scouting experience. They provide Youth Members with the opportunity to learn and develop essential outdoor skills. The OAS framework is broken into 9 skill areas, with 9 progressive levels for each area, allowing Youth Members to continuously build their competence and confidence. Additionally, specialty badges recognize advanced skills and expertise in specific areas.

### The 9 OAS Skill Areas:

1. **Bushcraft** <img src={require('../img/badges/Bushcraft.png').default} alt="Bushcraft Badge" className="badge-icon" />
   - Focus: Wilderness survival, shelter building, knots and lashings, fire lighting, and natural navigation.

2. **Bushwalking** <img src={require('../img/badges/Bushwalking.png').default} alt="Bushwalking Badge" className="badge-icon" />
   - Focus: Planning and undertaking bushwalks, using maps and compasses, and navigating challenging terrain.

3. **Camping** <img src={require('../img/badges/Camping.png').default} alt="Camping Badge" className="badge-icon" />

   - Focus: Skiing, snowboarding, and snow camping.


### The 9 Levels of Progression:

Each OAS area is divided into 9 levels. As Youth Members progress through each level, they gain mastery of skills, from beginner to expert.

- **Levels 1-3:** Introduction and foundational skills in Terrain 1 environments.
- **Levels 4-6:** Intermediate skills, typically in Terrain 2 environments.
- **Levels 7-9:** Advanced and leadership skills, often in Terrain 3 environments.

Youth Members progress at their own pace, and **Terrain** helps them visualize their growth and accomplishments throughout the program.

## Special Interest Areas (SIA)

Special Interest Areas allow Youth Members to explore activities and skills that are of personal interest to them. The six key areas are:
1. **Adventure & Sport** <img src={require('../img/badges/adventure_sport.png').default} alt="Adventure & Sport Badge" className="badge-icon" />

2. **Arts & Literature** <img src={require('../img/badges/arts_literature.png').default} alt="Arts & Literature Badge" className="badge-icon" />
   - Focus: Engaging in creative arts, literature, music, and cultural exploration.

3. **Creating a Better World** <img src={require('../img/badges/creating_better_world.png').default} alt="Creating a Better World Badge" className="badge-icon" />
   - Focus: Participating in community service, volunteering, and making a positive impact on the world.

### Project Tracking and Reflection:

All progress in **SIA projects** is tracked in the **Terrain System**. This system helps Youth Members record their goals, achievements, and reflections through the **Plan, Do, Review** process. 

Each SIA project follows the **Plan, Do, Review** framework to help Youth Members develop planning, execution, and reflection skills. The process is as follows:
- **Plan:** Youth Members set clear objectives for their project, including what they want to achieve and the steps required.
- **Do:** Youth Members carry out their project, putting their plan into action.
- **Review:** After completing the project, Youth Members reflect on what they learned, the challenges they faced, and how they might improve in the future.

Terrain allows Youth Members to see their completed projects and provides a structured framework to ensure personal growth and development.

### Project Duration by Section

Each SIA project is tailored to the age and experience level of the Youth Member, and the duration of each project varies by section:

- **Joey Scouts:** 2 hours
- **Cub Scouts:** 4 hours
- **Scouts:** 8 hours
- **Venturer Scouts:** 12 hours
- **Rover Scouts:** 18 hours

Projects can be completed individually or in groups (Project Patrols), with each Scout setting their own goals and reviewing progress upon completion.

### Terrain Considerations

Like OAS, SIA projects can involve different terrains based on the nature of the activity. For example:
- **Environment SIA projects** may involve working in a park (Terrain 1), conducting conservation efforts in a forest (Terrain 2), or managing an environmental project in a remote wilderness area (Terrain 3).
- **Adventure & Sport SIA projects** could involve participating in sports in a local field (Terrain 1), organizing a sports event in a hilly region (Terrain 2), or tackling a major physical challenge in a rugged landscape (Terrain 3).

### Support from Unit Council and Leadership

The **Unit Council** plays an important role in guiding and supporting Youth Members in their SIA projects:
- **Approval:** The Unit Council approves SIA projects at the planning stage and reviews them at completion.
- **Assistance:** The Unit Council may help find Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) or adjust project goals if necessary.
- **Encouragement:** Leaders and Unit Councils encourage Youth Members to challenge themselves and take ownership of their learning.

Youth Members also have access to resources on the *Scouts Terrain* platform, which provides templates and guides to help them structure their projects.

### How to Earn SIA Badges:
Youth Members choose a Special Interest Area, set a goal, and work towards achieving it using the **Plan, Do, Review** framework. The project is self-driven with guidance from Leaders. Once the goal is completed, and the project has been reviewed, the Youth Member earns their SIA badge.

## Milestones

Milestones are an important part of the Scouting journey, marking key achievements as Youth Members grow in the program. There are three milestones that can be earned:
- **Milestone 1**
- **Milestone 2**
- **Milestone 3**

Milestones are based on participation, leadership, and personal growth. They reflect a Youth Member's commitment to both the Scouting program and their personal development.
