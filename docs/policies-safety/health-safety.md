# Health and Safety

## Introduction

At Belmont Scouts, the health and safety of our members is our top priority. We are committed to providing a safe environment where Scouts can learn, grow, and have fun. This page outlines our key health and safety policies, including our commitment to child safety.

## General Health and Safety Policies

### First Aid and Emergency Procedures

We ensure that all activities are conducted with safety in mind. Qualified first aiders are present at all Scout meetings and events, and we have first aid kits readily available.

In the event of an emergency:
- Leaders will administer first aid as needed.
- Parents will be contacted immediately if their child requires medical attention.
- Emergency services will be called if the situation requires.

### Medical Information and Allergies

It's important that we have up-to-date medical information for all Scouts. Parents are required to:
- Complete and update medical information forms.
- Notify leaders of any allergies or medical conditions their child has.
- Provide any necessary medication, along with clear instructions for its use.

Leaders are trained to manage common medical situations, such as administering an EpiPen or dealing with asthma attacks.

### Outdoor Activity Safety

Outdoor activities are a key part of the Scouting experience. To ensure safety:
- Risk assessments are conducted for all activities.
- Leaders are trained in outdoor safety and survival skills.
- Scouts are instructed on safe practices before any activity begins.

We follow strict guidelines to ensure that all activities are age-appropriate and that Scouts have the necessary skills and equipment.

## Child Safety and Protection

### Child Safety Policy

Belmont Scouts is committed to the safety and well-being of all children and young people. We have a comprehensive Child Safety Policy that aligns with Scouts Australia's Child Protection guidelines.

### Code of Conduct for Leaders and Volunteers

All leaders and volunteers are required to adhere to a strict Code of Conduct that ensures:
- Respectful and appropriate behavior towards Scouts.
- No tolerance for bullying, harassment, or abuse.
- Clear boundaries between adults and young people.

Leaders are also required to undergo regular training on child safety and protection.

### Reporting Concerns

We encourage Scouts, parents, and leaders to speak up if they have any concerns about the safety or well-being of a child. Concerns can be reported to:
- A section leader or the Group Leader.
- The District or Region Commissioner.
- Scouts Queensland's Child Protection Team.

All reports are treated confidentially and are investigated thoroughly in accordance with Scouts Australia's procedures.

### Blue Card Requirements

All leaders and regular volunteers at Belmont Scouts are required to hold a valid Blue Card, which is a working with children check mandated by Queensland law. This ensures that everyone involved in the program has been properly vetted and is committed to maintaining a safe environment for all Scouts.

## COVID-19 Protocols

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented additional safety measures:
- Regular handwashing and use of hand sanitizers.
- Social distancing during meetings and activities where possible.
- Enhanced cleaning protocols for shared spaces and equipment.
- Monitoring and adherence to local health guidelines.

Parents will be informed of any changes to these protocols as the situation evolves.

## Contact Information
