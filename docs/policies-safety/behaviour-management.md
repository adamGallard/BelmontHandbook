# Behaviour Management

## Introduction
The Belmont Scout Group is committed to ensuring a positive and respectful environment for all Youth Members. This procedure outlines how Section Leaders will manage inappropriate behavior to maintain a safe, enjoyable, and fun atmosphere during Scout activities.

## Scope
This procedure applies to all sections of the Belmont Scout Group, including Joeys, Cubs, Scouts, and Venturers. It provides:
- Leaders with a framework for managing inappropriate behavior.
- Parents with an understanding of the behavior management approach.
- Youth Members with clear expectations of acceptable behavior and the consequences of inappropriate actions.

Leaders have discretion in how they implement this procedure, depending on the nature and seriousness of the behavior and its impact on others.

## Objective
The objectives of this procedure are:
- To ensure a consistent approach to managing inappropriate behavior.
- To create a safe and enjoyable environment for Youth Members and Leaders.
- To enable Leaders to focus on delivering quality programs for the Youth Members.

## How the Procedure Will Be Implemented

| Step | Incident          | Action |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| 1    | 1st Occurrence    | Leader will talk with the Youth Member and outline consequences if the behavior continues. |
| 2    | 2nd Occurrence    | Leader will talk with the Youth Member and instruct them to sit out the remainder of the activity. |
| 3    | 3rd Occurrence    | Leader will talk with the Youth Member and instruct them to sit out the remainder of the night. The Leader will advise the parent of the inappropriate behavior. |
| 4    | 4th Occurrence    | Leader will call the parent to come and collect the child. A meeting with the Leader, Group Leader, and parents will be arranged to implement a Behavior Management Plan. |

**Notes:**  
- Leaders will generally follow the steps in order; however, they may start the procedure at any step depending on the nature and seriousness of the behavior.
- The Group practices a "No yelling" policy. All incidents are managed in a calm and direct manner.

If an Assistant Leader identifies an incident, they will refer the matter to the Section Leader.

## Escalation
If further action is required, the Section Leader will escalate the issue to the Group Leader.

## Reporting
All incidents are recorded according to the Group's reporting procedure.
