# Parent Involvement

## Introduction

At Belmont Scouts, we believe that the involvement of parents and guardians is key to the success of our Scout group. Your participation not only supports your child's development but also strengthens our entire community.

## Why Parent Involvement Matters

Scouting is a partnership between leaders, Scouts, and their families. By getting involved, you contribute to the growth and success of the group, ensuring that every Scout has the opportunity to thrive. Your involvement also allows you to share in your child's Scouting journey, creating lasting memories together.

## Ways to Get Involved

### Parent Patrols

One of the most effective ways parents can support our Scout Group is by joining the **Parent Patrol**. Just like Scouts work together in patrols, the Parent Patrol is a group of parents who assist with various activities and tasks throughout the year. By working together, parents ensure that our events run smoothly and that there is always sufficient support for both leaders and Scouts.

The Parent Patrol may be involved in:
- **Fundraising Activities:** Assisting with planning, organizing, and running fundraising events.
- **Event Support:** Helping with set-up, supervision, and clean-up during camps, hikes, and other activities.
- **Transportation:** Providing transport for Scouts to and from events or helping organize carpooling.
- **Administrative Tasks:** Assisting with paperwork, communications, and other behind-the-scenes work.

### Fundraising Activities

Fundraising is an essential part of keeping our group running and ensuring that all Scouts have access to the best possible experiences. We rely on the support of families to make our fundraising efforts successful.

**Expectation:** Each family is expected to participate in at least two fundraising activities per year.

### Volunteering at Meetings

We welcome parents who can assist during meetings, whether it's helping to set up, assisting with activities, or providing refreshments.

### Joining the Committee

If you're interested in playing a more active role in the administration of the group, consider joining our committee. Committee members help plan events, manage finances, and ensure the group runs smoothly.

### Special Events and Camps

Throughout the year, we hold special events and camps that require additional support. Whether it's helping with transportation, preparing meals, or supervising activities, your involvement is always appreciated.

## Expectations for Families

### Fundraising Participation

As part of the Belmont Scouts community, we ask that each family commits to participating in at least two fundraising activities per year. This commitment is vital to our ability to provide quality programs and resources for our Scouts. Your participation ensures that we can continue to offer enriching experiences at an affordable cost.

### Parent Patrol Participation

We also encourage every family to take part in the Parent Patrol. By contributing your time and skills, you help create a positive and supportive environment for all our Scouts. Whether it's a single event or ongoing involvement, your participation makes a difference.

### Parent Skills Survey

We want to make the best use of the talents and skills within our community. Please take a moment to complete our [Parent Skills Survey](https://your-survey-link.com) so we can learn more about how you can contribute to our group's success.
