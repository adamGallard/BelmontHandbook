This system helps Youth Members record their goals, achievements, and reflections through the Plan, Do, Review process.  Each SIA project follows the Plan, Do, Review framework to help Youth Members develop planning, execution, and reflection skills. The process is as follows:  Plan: Youth Members set clear objectives for their project, including what they want to achieve and the steps required.Do: Youth Members carry out their project, putting their plan into action.Review: After completing the project, Youth Members reflect on what they learned, the challenges they faced, and how they might improve in the future.  Terrain allows Youth Members to see their completed projects and provides a structured framework to ensure personal growth and development.
